# Hate Speech Detector Project

## Overview
This project, a part of the Natural Language Processing (NLP) course, focuses on developing a tool to detect abusive and hateful language in Arabic tweets. It represents an important application of NLP in moderating online content and promoting healthier digital communication spaces.

### Project Scope
- **Objective:** To create an algorithm capable of identifying hate speech within Arabic tweets.
- **Data Processing:** Implementing a series of pre-processing techniques on a large dataset of tweets. These include:
  - Punctuation removal.
  - Text standardization.
  - Tokenization.
  - Stop-word removal.
  - Lemmatization.
  - Stemming.
- **Development Environment:** Utilizing Jupyter Notebook for scripting and testing.
- **Libraries Used:** NumPy, pandas, nltk, along with specific packages for stemming and lemmatization.

## Project Timeline
- **Duration:** March 2023 to May 2023

## Project Status
- The team is currently in the midst of the project, with ongoing efforts to refine and enhance the hate speech detection algorithm. There are plans to continue its development, potentially improving its accuracy and expanding its application to broader contexts.

This project not only provides practical experience in NLP and data processing but also contributes to the critical field of digital content moderation, addressing the growing concern of hate speech in online platforms.
