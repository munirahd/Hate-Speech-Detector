# Hate-Speech-Detector

• My team and I are currently engaged in another NLP project as part of my coursework for my NLP course. This project will Detect Abusive and Hateful Language in Arabic Tweets. It involves working with a large tweet dataset and implementing various data pre-processing techniques, such as punctuation removal, standardization, tokenization, stop-word removal, lemmatization, and stemming. We are actively working on the project, and we have plans to continue refining and enhancing it.

• Built with Jupiter Notebook, libraries such as NumPy, pandas, nltk, stemming, and lemmatization packages
